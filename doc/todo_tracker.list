data lineage

  requirements

    - layout shall use all available size
    - shapes shall be interactive
      - drag-able
      - click --> show poem
      - hover --> details
      - expandable
    - relations to be included/excluded
    - poems to be included/excluded
    - poems to have color/shape (rectangle, eclipse) options

navigation

  evaluate: have navigation as stand alone controller or part of poem.show action
  evaluate: move navigation into ajax procedures

poem

  general

    evaluate: rename parent into poem_type

  poem without parent

    defines values

      evaluate: control creation of new values for children (eg. forbid by setting flag)

      done: name
      done: value
      done: overwrite option

      type
        input
        text field
        selection list
        check box
        radio buttons
        flag
      [options]
        fixed options
        dynamic options

      canceled:
        "propagates changes in value definition to poems of this type (reference value)" not done
        because original settings are read from referenced value

    defines relation types

      foundation to create references between poems

      maybe: at this level lineage could show structuring of poem types
        seems expensive compared to additional value of relation table listing

      done: create, show, edit (edit function was deleted, see relation type section), delete

  poem with parent

    do: convert poem into poem type (detach from parent; confirmation needed)

relations

  do: allow name concatenation (BT --> TABLE --> COLUMN could become BT --> TABLE.COLUMN) oerks!
  do: provide all (inbound/outbound) relations, but eliminate redundancies (self reflecting relations; take care!)

values

  thesis

    reference value -> everything is derived from reference value, except the value itself
    local value -> value could only be text field
    new value & poem has children -> value with reference added to children; default value is copied
    new poem -> existing value definitions are copied by creating reference values

  done: not editable option (like constant value for certain poem types)
  done: not removable option

html/css

  styles

    normal                  any value/content, which is displayed in normal manner --> belongs to body
    emphasized              highlighted content, but without any functionality (navigation/action)
    link                    everything click-able
    focus                   a) focused by "nature" because of workflow, or b) focused by :hover

  general:

    do: hover pointer for buttons
    eval: ref/href attributes, hypermedia stuff
    do: small icon for web site

shakespeare general

  mobile

    check: mobile behaviour
    check: specific css

  configuration

    evaluate: config file or table

    possible entries:
      inheritance_level: how deep changes to poem type are propagate to children; 0,1,n,...,full
